# Feature Ideas

## Multi-user observations

Include multiple users on an observation/occurrence so they can share credit for the sighting.

## Species interactions

First-class way to specify interactions between species/taxa on an observation (e.g., predation, pollination, parasitism, symbiosis).

## Multiple species per image

Ability to identify multiple species in a single image, rather than requiring separate observations for each organism.
